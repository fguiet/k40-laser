# Using K40 Laser Cutter – The rules of thumb

## Powering the CO2 Tube

* [Do not overpower the CO2 Tube](https://k40.se/k40-laser-troubleshooting/dead-lasertube/). Keep the ammeter below 18mA (around 2.5v on my K40).

## Cooling water

* Only use pure distilled water, never add watercooling stuff

## Before turning the machine ON

* Put your CO2 Laser proof google on
* Check all buttons are in OFF position
* Check that your potentiometer is set to the minimum (ie you should not be able to turn it anticlockwise)
* [Check CO2 Laser tube water temperature](https://k40.se/k40-laser-troubleshooting/dead-lasertube/), it should be between 15-20 °C. It can run if temperature is between 21-23°C but it reduces the CO2 tube life time.

## Turning the machine ON

1.	Check water temperature, it should not be above 20°C
Check no bubbles and water flow
