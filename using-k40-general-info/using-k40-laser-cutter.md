# Using K40 Laser Cutter – The rules of thumb

## Default Settings

* Laser cut area (my upgraded version) : 280mm x 180 mm

* Laser tube power : 40 W

* Lens diameter : 12 mm

* Focal lenght : 50.8 mm

* 3 Mirrors : 20 mm

I bought mine on AliExpress : <https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005001374933857.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27426c37F8tu4Z>

I have choosen a warehouse located in Czech Republic and I have paid : __349 euros (with DHL shipping included)__

## Powering the CO2 Tube

* [Do not overpower the CO2 Tube](https://k40.se/k40-laser-troubleshooting/dead-lasertube/). Keep the ammeter below 18mA (which is around 2.5v on the voltmeter of my K40).

## Cooling water

* Only use pure distilled water, never add watercooling stuff

## Before turning the machine ON

* __Put your CO2 Laser proof google on__
* Check all buttons are in OFF position
* Check that your potentiometer is set to the minimum (ie you should not be able to turn it anticlockwise)
* [Check CO2 Laser tube water temperature](https://k40.se/k40-laser-troubleshooting/dead-lasertube/), it should be between 15-20 °C. It can run if temperature is between 21-23°C but it reduces the CO2 tube life time.
* From time to time, check bed leveling

## Turning the machine ON

1.	Turn the water pump ON and eliminate all the bubbles in the CO2 Laser tube (on my laser I need to raise it towards me to get rid of bubbles on the left side of the laser tube)
2.
